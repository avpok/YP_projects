Data Analysis of Yandex.Music Service: Comparing Users from Two Cities | Internet Services, Streaming Service | Pandas, Python | Using real data from Yandex.Music, analyze the data with Pandas library to compare the behavior and preferences of users from two capitals - Moscow and St. Petersburg. | Myths surround the comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg: 1) Moscow - a metropolis subject to a rigid workweek rhythm; 2) St. Petersburg - a city of unique culture, unlike Moscow. Some myths reflect reality. Others are empty stereotypes. Businesses must distinguish the first from the second to make rational decisions. With real data from Yandex.Music, you will verify the data and compare the behavior of users from the two capitals. | data processing, duplicates, gaps, logical indexing, grouping, sorting |
Creditworthiness Investigation. Analysis of Banking Data | Banking, Credit | Pandas, Python, data preprocessing | Based on statistics on clients' solvency, investigate whether a client's marital status and the number of children influence timely loan repayment. | Based on data from the bank's credit department, I researched the impact of marital status and the number of children on loan repayment. Information was collected and gaps were processed. Data types were changed to match the stored data. Duplicates were removed. Data was categorized. One dataframe was decomposed into three. | data processing, duplicates, gaps, categorization, decomposition |
| Selling Apartments in St. Petersburg. Real Estate Market Analysis | Internet Services, Listing Platforms | Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing | Using data from Yandex.Real Estate service, determine the market value of real estate properties and typical apartment characteristics. | Based on data from Yandex.Real Estate service, the market value of various types of real estate properties and typical apartment characteristics were determined, depending on their distance from the city center. Data preprocessing was conducted. New data was added. Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots were created. | data processing, histogram, box plot, scatter matrix, categorization, scatter plot, fraud monitoring |
Studying Patterns that Define Game Success | Game Development, Online Stores, Offline | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data preprocessing, statistical hypothesis testing | Using historical data on computer game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms, identify patterns that determine game success. | Parameters defining game success in different regions of the world were identified. Based on this, a report for a computer game store was prepared for planning advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were conducted. A relevant period for analysis was chosen. User profiles for each region were created. Hypotheses were tested: average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same; average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different. The Student's t-test was used for independent samples in the analysis. | data processing, histogram, box plot, statistical test, Student's t-test, pie chart |
Tariff Recommendation | Telecom | Classification, Machine Learning: Matplotlib, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn | Based on data, suggest a tariff plan to the customer. | A mobile operator discovered that many customers are using old tariff plans. They want to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and suggesting one of the new tariffs. | classification, hyperparameter tuning, model selection |
| Predicting Customer Churn for a Bank | Banking, Business, Investments, Credit | Classification, Machine Learning, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn | Based on bank data, identify customers who may leave. | Customers have been leaving the bank, a few every month. Bank marketers calculated that retaining existing customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones. It is necessary to predict whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future. Historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank have been provided. | classification, hyperparameter tuning, model selection |
Determining the Most Profitable Oil Extraction Region | Extractive Companies | Pandas, Scikit-learn, bootstrap | Based on geological exploration data, select the oil extraction region. | You have been provided with oil samples from three regions. Characteristics for each well in the region are already known. Build a machine learning model to determine the region where extraction will yield the highest profit. | regression, business model development, bootstrap |
| Study of the Technological Gold Refining Process | Industry | Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Python, Scikit-learn, exploratory data analysis | Forecast the gold concentration during the gold refining process. | A machine learning model is being built for an industrial company that develops solutions for efficient industrial plant operations. The model should predict the gold recovery rate from gold-bearing ore based on data with extraction and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production to avoid launching plants with unprofitable characteristics. | data analysis, regression, custom metrics |
